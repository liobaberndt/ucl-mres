# Session 6: Fill Out the Pre-Registration Sections

## What you will learn in this session

In this session you will:

- **slowly fill out** each section of the pre-registration in your **Overleaf pre-reg project**
- Use what you wrote in Sessions 1–4 (thesis Overleaf) and decided in Session 3 (settings) to draft clear, precise pre-reg text
- Produce a **draft pre-registration** ready for supervisor feedback and eventual submission (e.g. OSF, AsPredicted)

You may spread this over more than one sitting; “slowly” means section by section, with care.

## Part 0 - Git workflow

Before starting:

```bash
git pull
```

After completing (or after each subsection you finish):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Module 4 Session 6: pre-reg section [name]"
git push
```

## Part A - Where the content comes from

- **Background / rationale, hypotheses**: From Session 1 (what DCM is, why E/I, hypothesis re BSNIP biotypes) and your thesis Overleaf.
- **Design, sample**: From your study (B-SNIP, task, EEG/MEG, preprocessing as in Modules 2).
- **Analysis plan**: From Module 3 & 4. Be specific: sources, design, PSD settings, software, PEB design matrix and covariates.

---

## Part B - Fill out sections slowly

Work through the structure you created in Session 5. 

---

## Part C - Tips

- **Be specific**: “We will use PEB with covariates X, Y, Z” is better than “We will do group statistics.”
- **Match your one-subject run**: The analysis plan should describe exactly what you did in Module 2,3,4 (and will do for all subjects), so no surprise analyses later.
- **Ask for feedback**: Share the Overleaf pre-reg link with me. If you ahev any questions, let me know. I'll provide teh first round of feedback. Then, Daniel will give some feedbacka nd ultimetely Rick and then we can submit.

## Session 6 checklist

You are finished if:

- all main sections of the pre-registration are **filled out** in the Overleaf pre-reg project
- the **analysis plan** clearly states: DCM for PSD + E/I (dcm_ei), one-subject validation, PEB with specified covariates and group-level inference
- you have requested or received **feedback** on the draft
- you are ready to **submit** (or have submitted) the pre-registration to your chosen registry (OSF, AsPredicted, etc.)
- you have committed and pushed any final notes to the repo
